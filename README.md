# Django project template built on Docker


## Usage

To use this template, first ensure that you have
[Cookiecutter](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/readme.html) available. 
If not, you can install it from pip: `pip install cookiecutter`.

Then just execute:
    
    cookiecutter dir/to/django-template/

It will ask you a few questions, e.g. project's name.

After generation completes, search for any TODOs in the code and make appropriate changes where needed.

See README.md in the generated project for instructions on how to set up your development environment.
